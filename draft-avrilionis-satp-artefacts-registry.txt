Abstract

   This memo describes the Artefacts Registry for Asset Exchange API.
   The Registry is a component that exposes an API allowing gateways to
   fetch information related to the SAT protocol.  Examples information
   stored in the Artefacts Registry are network identifiers, entities
   identifiers, asset profiles, or asset instances.  Registries are are
   acting as persistent storage locations for records.  Once registered,
   records can be updated in an append-only manner.

1.  Introduction

   This memo proposes an API intended to be implemented by Artefact
   Registries in the context of SATP.  A Registry is a component that
   exposes an API allowing gateways to fetch artefacts related to the
   SAT protocol ("API3").  Examples of SATP artefacts are network
   identifiers, entities identifiers, asset profiles, or asset
   instances.

   Registries play an important role in maintaining record of artefacts
   that are important during the Setup Stage of SATP (a.k.a “Stage 0”).
   Registries are are acting as persistent storage locations for such
   artefacts.  Once registered, artefacts cannot be removed.  New
   versions are appended in the Registry without removing previous
   versions (append-only principle).  Readers are directed first to
   [REGARCH] for a description of the architecture underlying the
   Registries.

   All API calls are assumed to run over TLS1.2 or higher, and the
   endpoints of the registry are associated with a certificate
   indicating the legal owner (or operator) of the Registry.  HTTPS must
   be used instead of plain HTTP.

2.  Conventions used in this document

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [REQ-LEVEL].

   In this document, these words will appear with that interpretation
   only when in ALL CAPS.  Lower case uses of these words are not to be
   interpreted as carrying significance described in RFC 2119.

3.  Terminology

   Please refer to [TERM] for the terminology used in this document.

   The artefacts recorded via registries are called Tokenized Asset
   Records or TARs.  Please refer to [REGARCH] for more information
   about TARs.

4.  The Registry API

4.1.  Overview

   The Registry API pertains to the interaction between gateways.  In
   [ARCH] such interface was identied as "API3" - see [ARCH] for more
   details.

4.2.  The role of the Registry in SATP

   The three stages of the SATP protocol are described in [CORE].  Prior
   to the initiation of SATP the peer gateways may access artefacts
   related to networks, assets or the gateway themselves.  Registries
   are used to maintain record of such artefacts.  Registries are of
   particular importance in the interactions between the peer gateways
   during the setup stage (Stage-0) [STAGE0]

   Records stored in a registry are persisted in the form of Tokenized
   Artefacts Record (TAR).  In summary the main concepts of a TAR are as
   follows:

   *  The Artefact: This is a piece of information containing digitized
      data or pointing to assets.  It can range from configuration data,
      execution log, network identifier, as well as any form of tangible
      or intangible asset, such as real estate, art, company shares, or
      even intellectual property.

   *  The Token: A digital token is created on a network to represent a
      specific piece of information or an asset.

   *  The Record: The token acts as the immutable record of ownership.
      It contains vital data about the artefact (metadata), ownership
      history, and rules for transfer, all secured by a network.

5.  Registry API Message Format, identifiers and Descriptors

5.1.  Overview

   This section describes the Registry API message-types, the format of
   the messages, the format for resource descriptors and other related
   parameters.

5.2.  API Digital Signatures and Key Types

   All API calls must be signed, using JSON Web Signatures mechanism
   (RFC7515).

   Registries SHOULD support the algorithms defined in the JSON Web
   Algorithms (JWA) specification [RFC7518] and key types defined in the
   JSON Web Key (JWK) specification [RFC7517].

   All registries implementing the API must implement at minimal the
   ECDSA signature algorithm with the P-256 curve and the SHA-256 hash
   function.

   Additional signature algorithms and keying parameters may be
   implemented by the registries.  However, these are outside the scope
   of this specification.

5.3.  Registry Message Format and Payloads

   All registry API messages are in JSON format [JSON].

5.3.1.  Protocol version

   This refers to the registry API Version, encoded as "major.minor"
   (separated by a period symbol).

   The endpoints of the registry should clearly indicate the version of
   the API.  The current version is "1.0" defined in this specification.
   Implementations not understanding a future option value should return
   an appropriate error response and cease the negotiation.

5.3.2.  Client Credential Types Supported by Registries

   Registries must support JSON Web Tokens (JWT) [RFC 7519] with
   OAUth2.0 [RFC6749] as the minimal credential type for authenticating
   incoming API calls.

   A registry may support additional credential mechanisms, which may be
   advertised by the registry through different mechanisms (e.g. config
   file at a well-known endpoint).  However, these mechanisms are out of
   scope for the current specification.

5.3.3.  Registry Supported TLS Schemes

   Registries must suport TLS1.2 or higher [RFC8448].

   The TLS scheme is used by client applications to call the Registry
   endpoints.  Registries must a minimal support the AES-128 in GCM mode
   with SHA-256 (TLS_AES_128_GCM_SHA256).

5.3.4.  Client Offers Other Supported TLS Schemes

   If a client application wishes to use TLS schemes other then the
   basic scheme (AES-128 in GCM mode with SHA-256), then the client may
   choose to send a JSON block containing information regarding the
   client's supported TLS schemes.

5.3.5.  Registry Identifier

   This is the unique identifier of the registry service.  The registry
   identifier MUST be uniquely bound to its endpoint (e.g. via X.509
   certificates).

   This registry identifier is distinct from the registry operator
   business identifier (e.g., legal entity identifier (LEI) number).

   A registry operator may operate multiple registries.  Each of the
   registries MUST be identified by a unique registry identifier.

   The mechanisms to establish the registry identifier or the operator
   identifier is outside the scope of this specification.

5.3.6.  Signature Algorithms Supported

   This is a JSON list of digital signature algorithms supported by a
   registry.  Each entry in the list should be either an Algorithm Name
   value registered in the IANA "JSON Web Signature and Encryption
   Algorithms" registry established by [JWA] or be a value that contains
   a Collision-Resistant Name.

   All implementations must support a common default of "ES256", which
   is the ECDSA signature algorithm with the P-256 curve and the SHA-256
   hash function.

5.3.7.  JSON Canonicalisation

   Registries must suport JSON Canonicalization [RFC8785].

6.  Overview of API endpoints

   Registries MUST support the use of the HTTP GET and POST methods
   defined in RFC 2616 [RFC2616] for the endpoint.

   Clients MAY use the HTTP GET or POST methods to send messages to the
   registry.

   If using the HTTP GET method, the request parameters may be
   serialized using URI Query String Serialization.

   (NOTE: Flows occur over TLS.  Nonces are not shown).

6.1.  TAR Creation

6.1.1.  Call

   This endpoint stores the input data in the regitry permanent storage
   and returns a token identifier related to the TAR.  The call should
   return as soon as the input data are persisted in the registry.  In
   case of asynchronous creation of the token identifier associated to
   the TAR a temporary receipt should be returned.  Such receipt should
   be substituted with the permanent token identifier.

   This endpoint uses an HTTP POST method

   Here is an example representation in JSON format:
